<h2>
What is the biggest achievement in f1?
</h2>
<h3>
Most Drivers' World Championships.

Lewis Hamilton remains atop the record table alongside Michael Schumacher with seven titles apiece. The German was dominant at the turn of the century, winning five titles on the bounce with Ferrari. These were in addition to his double world championships with Benetton in the '90s.
</h3>
<h2>
What are points in F1?
</h2>
<h3>
Points are awarded to drivers and teams based on where they finish in a race. The winner receives 25 points, the second-place finisher 18 points, with 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 and 1 points for positions 3 through 10, respectively.
</h3>
<h2>
Why do they play a national anthem for pole position winners?
</h2>
<h3>
The question has caught the attention of F1 fans. In every F1 Grand Prix podium celebration, two national anthems are played: one for the winning driver, and the other for their team. The anthem depends on the nationality of the driver and the original country to which the team belongs.
</h3>
<h2>
Why is an f1 car different than any other sports car?
</h2>
<h3>
Aerodynamics. This is one of the most important factors distinguishing them from other cars. The shape of the F1 car is designed in such a way that air resistance at high speed is minimal, and the car is pressed as hard as possible to the track's surface.
</h3>
<h2>
What do the different tyres mean in f1?
</h2>
<h3>
Every race has soft, medium, and hard tyre compounds, and each has its benefits and trade-offs. The soft tyre provides the most grip but isn't durable; the hard tyre will last the longest but isn't as grippy; and the medium tyre offers the best of both without excelling at either.
